# RoboCap-SulesAdventure
### Coding Blocks Game Jam 2021
4 day jam, started on the 2nd day.    
https://itch.io/jam/coding-blocks-2021/rate/892846
  <br/><br/>
My goal for this jam was to actually finish something and see where my weak points lie when put under a short time-constraint. 

One very clear point is clean code which sprouted from beginning on a bigger scope than was possible for me alone.  
This also caused me to compromise on the overall aesthetic of the game, being clear on what means what visually and balancing.   
The procedural animation part of Robo-Cap took me the longest where I learned a lot about working with procedural animation and animation curves.   <br/><br/>

Most of the overarching code was made during the last day before submission. (excluding the animation code)  <br/>
Most of the uses of singletons and publics, especially where they were placed, were there because of bad project-time management.  <br/> <br/>

On my next project I would like to start by writing down a clear design, so I know beforehand where and what classes, properties, fields, functions and interfaces I will be using
with the goal of minimizing "spaghetti code" . In turn opening up more time for potential refactoring.
